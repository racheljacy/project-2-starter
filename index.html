      <br>
      PACN is a production created and funded by Kababayan - a registered all-student run
organization at UCI that aims to promote awareness of both current and transgenerational Pilipinx-
American issues. Kababayan always strives to celebrate the diversity, resilience, and beauty of
Pilipinx-American culture, while encouraging education about the culture to those in the surrounding
community. In modern media, Asian Americans and Pilipinx-Americans in particular are rarely given
the opportunity to shine, as we are often reduced to playing stereotypes, sidekicks, or comedic relief.
Over the past 45 years, PACN has worked to challenge this idea by cultivating a cultural movement
through our diverse visual and performing arts showcases, including: theater, choir, and cultural
dances (Kordilyera, Maria Clara, Mindanao, Rural, Tribal and Modern dance). We are a self-funded
program that strives to create a safe space that supports and empowers each member to fully
explore their passions, whether that be on stage or behind the scenes production work, both of which
are equally significant to a successful show.
