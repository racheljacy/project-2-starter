            <p>What is PACN?</p>
            <p> <div class="flex-tile">First started in 1979, PACN is a production where Kababayan at UCI comes together to showcase the issues, lifestyle, and culture of Pilipinx-Americans through cultural dances, music and an original story. 
                <br>
                <br>Through PACN, we aim to simultaneously celebrate well-known aspects of the cultures of the Philippines while also highlighting underrepresented communities by interpreting their customs untouched by colonization.
                <br>
                <br>More importantly, PACN embodies the beautifully diverse arts of the Philippines and shows how we choose to embody and embrace that in our current environment.
